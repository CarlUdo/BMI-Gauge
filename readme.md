# Fullstack Weekend Project

The primary goal with this project is to show that you can build a simple(!) fullstack application.

A secondary goal is to show how well you can write code by using good function/variable names, good tests, small functions, and overall tidy code.

## Presentation

- You will review another developer's code next week.
- You will present the project next week for the rest of the class.
- The presentation should include a brief overview of the planning done and code structure.
- The presentation should include a code improvement from the code review, and a positive example of high quality code.

## Requirements

1. A public repository on your own github profile with a readme.md and two folders; `frontend/` and `backend/`.
1. A screenshot of a big picture plan in the readme.
1. A link to the planning board in the readme.
1. You should use microsteps with expectations before you code.
1. Any other relevant information in the readme regarding the project idea and choices made.
1. All JS code should be written with TypeScript.
1. An `index.html` file with a form.
1. A server that takes a request from the web client and responds with JSON data.
1. Server code separated into a functional core and imperative shell.
1. The functional core must have unit tests. TDD is highly encouraged.
1. The functional core should not have any side-effects in it.
1. All side-effects should be in the imperative shell.
1. The imperative shell does not need to have any automated tests.
1. The frontend should only trigger the server and show the result. Keep the logic server-side as much as possible.
1. You should incorporate a new technincal concept that you haven't used before. It can be a library, a way of coding, a framework, etc.
1. Document the new technical concept in the readme, together with your learning journey.

## Tips

- Choose a small project idea and small new technical concept. You can always scale it when you are done with the requirements.
- As styling is out of scope for this assignment, you can use https://picocss.com/ to get basic styling without coding CSS.
- Make it work, then improve it.
- Don't be afraid to throw any or all code away and start over with your gained knowledge. Learning is progress!
- If you feel overwhelmed, you can find my phone number on Slack. Please use it, and we can help get you back on track. You are not alone! For smaller issues, you can just DM me on Slack.
- Check your spelling and overall presentational style of the project. This includes git commits and the readme.
- Do not copy code. Write it over in micro-steps. If you copy, you remove learning resistance and might look like you are doing great early in the course, and then you totally fail later in the course.
